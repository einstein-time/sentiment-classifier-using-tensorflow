Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. 
Sentiment analysis models focus on polarity (positive, negative, neutral) but also on feelings and emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc), urgency (urgent, not urgent) and even intentions (interested v. not interested). 
Sentiment analysis is extremely important because it helps businesses quickly understand the overall opinions of their customers. By automatically sorting the sentiment behind reviews, social media conversations, and more, you can make faster and more accurate decisions.
Sentiment analysis, otherwise known as opinion mining, works thanks to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, to automatically determine the emotional tone behind online conversations.
